# Data Journalism and D3

The data is provided by UCSD Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.

"The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error.""

### What I did (D3 Dabbler):

![4-scatter](Images/4-scatter.jpg)

* I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables: `Healthcare vs. Poverty`.

* Using the D3 techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements.

* I Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

![8-tooltip](Images/8-tooltip.jpg)

* Incorporate d3-tip: Using the `d3-tip.js` plugin developed by [Justin Palmer](https://github.com/Caged), I incorporated tooltips to the circles and displayed each tooltip with the data you mouseover.
